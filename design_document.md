# Playwright MVP for Model Context Protocol (MCP) Evaluation Flow - Design Document

## 1. Understanding MCP Evaluation Flow

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) evaluation flow typically involves:
- **Context Submission**: A user or system submits a piece of context (e.g., a document, a code snippet, a conversation history) to a model for evaluation.
- **Model Processing**: The model processes the context based on predefined tasks or queries.
- **Evaluation**: The model's output is evaluated against certain criteria (e.g., accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety).
- **Reporting**: Evaluation results are reported, often with tags or metadata for analysis.

For this MVP, we will assume a simplified MCP evaluation flow where context is submitted via a web UI or directly via an API, processed by a hypothetical backend, and then evaluated. The focus of the MVP is on the test automation aspect.

## 2. Web UI Test Scope

The Web UI tests will cover the user-facing aspects of the MCP evaluation flow. This includes:
- **Context Submission Form**: Testing the submission of various types of context (text, file uploads if applicable) through a web form.
- **Validation Feedback**: Verifying that the UI provides appropriate feedback for invalid context submissions.
- **Evaluation Trigger**: Ensuring that submitting context correctly triggers the backend evaluation process.
- **Basic Reporting View**: If a simple reporting view exists, verifying that evaluation results are displayed correctly on the UI.

## 3. API Test Scope

The API tests will focus on the backend functionality, ensuring robustness and correctness of the MCP evaluation process. This includes:
- **Context Submission API**: Testing the direct submission of context via API endpoints, including various data formats and edge cases.
- **Validation API**: Verifying that the API correctly validates submitted context and returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Evaluation Trigger API**: Confirming that API submissions initiate the evaluation process.
- **Results Retrieval API**: Testing the retrieval of evaluation results via API, including filtering and pagination if supported.

## 4. Context Submission and Validation Plan

- **Context Generation**: We will generate diverse test contexts, including valid and invalid examples, different lengths, and various content types (e.g., plain text, JSON, potentially mock file content).
- **Validation Rules**: We will define clear validation rules for context (e.g., maximum length, required fields, data format) and implement tests to ensure these rules are enforced by both the UI and API.
- **Error Handling**: Tests will verify that the system handles invalid context gracefully, providing informative error messages.

## 5. CI Pipeline Integration Strategy

- **Platform**: We will target GitHub Actions for CI integration, as it is widely used and provides good Playwright support.
- **Workflow**: The CI pipeline will be configured to run the Playwright tests on every push to the main branch or pull request.
- **Environment**: The CI environment will be set up to install Node.js, Playwright, and any other necessary dependencies.
- **Reporting**: Test results will be generated in a format compatible with CI platforms (e.g., JUnit XML) for easy integration and visualization.

## 6. Tagged Reporting Strategy

- **Playwright Tags**: We will leverage Playwright's built-in tagging mechanism to categorize tests (e.g., `@web_ui`, `@api`, `@smoke`, `@regression`).
- **Reporting Tools**: We will use Playwright's default HTML reporter for local viewing and potentially integrate with a more advanced reporting tool (e.g., Allure Report) for richer, tagged reports in CI.
- **Custom Tags**: Custom tags will be used to denote specific features, components, or test types, allowing for granular reporting and filtering of test results.
