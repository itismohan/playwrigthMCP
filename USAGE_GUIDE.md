"Check if the authentication endpoint accepts valid tokens"
```

### Mixed Testing Examples

#### End-to-End Workflows
```
"Test the complete user registration workflow"
"Verify the entire e-commerce checkout process"

```

#### Integration Testing
```
"Register a new user and verify API response"
"Submit contact form and check database entry"
"Test payment flow from UI to API confirmation"
```

## üé® Understanding the Interface

### Chat Interface Elements

1. **Header**: Shows the assistant name and description
2. **Message Area**: Displays conversation history
3. **Input Field**: Where you type your testing requests
4. **Send Button**: Submits your request
5. **Quick Actions**: Pre-defined test examples

### Message Types

- **User Messages**: Your testing requests (blue background)
- **Assistant Messages**: AI responses and confirmations (white background)
- **System Messages**: Status updates and errors (colored backgrounds)

### Status Indicators

- üü° **Pending**: Test is queued for execution
- üîµ **Running**: Test is currently executing
- üü¢ **Completed**: Test finished successfully
- üî¥ **Failed**: Test encountered an error

## üìä Test Results Breakdown

### Result Card Components

1. **Header**: Test status, execution time, and overall result
2. **Test Steps**: Expandable list of individual actions
3. **Screenshots**: Visual captures at each step
4. **Logs**: Detailed execution information
5. **Summary**: Final test outcome and duration

### Reading Test Steps

Each test step shows:
- **Action**: What was performed (e.g., "navigate to URL", "click button")
- **Status**: Success or failure indicator
- **Logs**: Detailed information about the action
- **Screenshot**: Visual proof of the action (when applicable)

### Screenshot Analysis

Screenshots help you:
- Verify the correct page was loaded
- See the state before and after actions
- Identify visual issues or layout problems
- Confirm successful interactions

## üîß Advanced Usage Tips

### Writing Effective Test Prompts

#### Be Specific
‚ùå "Test the website"
‚úÖ "Test the login form on https://example.com"

#### Include URLs
‚ùå "Check the API"
‚úÖ "Check if the API endpoint https://api.example.com/users returns valid JSON"

#### Specify Actions
‚ùå "Test the form"
‚úÖ "Fill out the contact form with test data and submit it"

### Combining Multiple Actions

You can request complex workflows:
```
"Navigate to example.com, click the login button, fill in test credentials, submit the form, and verify successful login"
```

### Error Handling

When tests fail, the system provides:
- Detailed error messages
- Screenshots of the failure point
- Logs showing what went wrong
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## üéØ Best Practices

### For UI Testing

1. **Always include the target URL** for better accuracy
2. **Be specific about elements** you want to interact with
3. **Request screenshots** to verify visual state
4. **Test one workflow at a time** for clearer results

### For API Testing

1. **Provide complete endpoint URLs** when possible
2. **Specify expected response format** (JSON, XML, etc.)
3. **Include HTTP method** if not GET (POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. **Mention authentication** if required

### For Mixed Testing

1. **Break down complex workflows** into clear steps
2. **Specify both UI and API expectations**
3. **Include validation points** throughout the process
4. **Test error scenarios** as well as happy paths

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Test Timeouts
**Issue**: Test takes too long to complete
**Solution**: Break down into smaller, specific actions

### Element Not Found
**Issue**: UI test can't find the specified element
**Solution**: Be more specific about element description or use alternative selectors

### API Connection Errors
**Issue**: Cannot connect to API endpoint
**Solution**: Verify the URL is correct and accessible

### Screenshot Issues
**Issue**: Screenshots appear blank or incorrect
**Solution**: Ensure the page has fully loaded before taking screenshots

## üìà Interpreting Results

### Successful Tests
- Green checkmarks indicate success
- Screenshots show expected state
- Logs confirm actions were completed
- Summary shows "Passed" status

### Failed Tests
- Red X marks indicate failures
- Error messages explain what went wrong
- Screenshots show failure state
- Logs provide debugging information

### Partial Success
- Some steps may succeed while others fail
- Review individual step results
- Use logs to understand failure points
- Retry with modified prompts if needed

## üîÑ Iterative Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic tests
2. **Add Complexity**: Gradually increase test complexity
3. **Learn from Failures**: Use error messages to improve prompts
4. **Refine Prompts**: Adjust language based on results
5. **Build Workflows**: Combine successful tests into larger workflows

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use the quick action buttons for common test patterns
- Save successful prompts for reuse
- Take screenshots at key points for visual verification
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Use specific, descriptive language for better AI interpretation
